## 🔥 Highlights

- A Vision-Language-Action framework for closed-loop humanoid loco-manipulation control in large space.
- A novel approach for learning unified latent actions from manipulation and manipulation-aware locomotion videos without action annotations.
- A locomotion-oriented reinforcement learning policy that enables precise and stable whole-body coordination under disturbances.

## 📋 Overview

WholeBodyVLA is a unified Vision-Language-Action framework for large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It learns unified latent actions from action-free egocentric videos through a Latent Action Model (LAM), and employs a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy for precise and stable whole-body coordination. The system encodes egocentric images and language instructions into latent action tokens, which are decoded into dual-arm joint actions and locomotion commands, enabling end-to-end control for complex loco-manipulation tasks.
